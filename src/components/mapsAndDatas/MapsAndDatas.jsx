The end user benefits from multiple data types and resolutions. While researchers and office managers can get information across vast areas, the field operations staff see local details from granular data. All this is from one common source of integrated and routinely updated information. Using GIS mapping tools for creating thematic, isoline or heat maps is equally rewarding for spatial analytics and visual interpretation.</p>
                    <p className='text-sm md:text-lg text-justify font-parkinsans my-4'>Built on stringent standards and versioned over 31 years, our data sets and digital India maps are the most reliable and accurate.
