        Our map data is curated for optimal processing speed and response time,
        spatial analytics and 3D visualisation. The end user benefits from
        multiple data types and resolutions. While researchers and office
        managers can get information across vast areas, the field operations
        staff see local details from granular data. All this is from one common
        source of integrated and routinely updated information. Using GIS
        mapping tools for creating thematic, isoline or heat maps is equally
        rewarding for spatial analytics and visual interpretation.

        Built on stringent standards and versioned over 31 years, our data sets
        and digital India maps are the most reliable and accurate. Temporal

        Our map data sets are diligently created by our mapping staff, skilled
        in separating good from bad data. Our expert team of technicians
        collate, aggregate and integrate data from multiple primary and
        secondary sources, historical records, maps, high resolution satellite
        images and create seamless, accurately aligned and layered countrywide
        vector maps of India. The high density of locations points for hundreds
        of data items relating to demography, agriculture, climate, terrain
        etc., enables effective pattern recognition.
